**🎮 2D Action-Adventure Game (Godot Engine)**
A 2D action-adventure game developed as part of a collaborative software engineering project. Built using the Godot Engine, this project focuses on core gameplay mechanics, character controls, combat, enemy AI, and engaging level design.
This game demonstrates structured software design, clean architecture, and teamwork throughout development.

**📌 Project Overview**

This game was created to explore the fundamentals of game development, including gameplay systems, player control, combat mechanics, and enemy behavior. The project emphasizes modular design, maintainability, and user experience.

**Key Features**

Smooth player movement, jumping, and combat attacks

Multiple enemies with basic AI behaviors

Level design using TileSets and scenes

Inventory, health system, and in-game interactions

Main menu and in-game UI elements

Scalable, maintainable subsystem design

Collaboration through GitHub and structured development practices

**🧩 Gameplay Systems**
✔ Player Controls

Movement (walk, run, jump, double jump)

Combat actions and animations

Responsive input handling

Collision and hitbox detection

✔ Combat Mechanics

Player and enemy attack logic

Damage application

Attack animations

Hit detection & knockback

✔ Enemy AI

Movement patterns

Basic decision-making

Health & damage states

Interaction with combat system

✔ Level & UI Design

Tile-based levels

Scene management

In-game UI (health, score, menus)

Pause menu, settings menu, and navigation

**🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)**

The project is designed using modular subsystems: 

SDD Template (1)

Player Control Subsystem – input, movement, traversal, animations

Combat Subsystem – attack logic, damage, collision

Enemy AI Subsystem – behavior and movement patterns

Menu System – title screen, in-game menus, settings

Game State Subsystem – camera follow, health, score, level state

This structure ensures flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
