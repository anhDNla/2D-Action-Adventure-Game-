## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

This project uses a modular subsystem architecture:

- **Player Control Subsystem** – movement, input, animations  
- **Combat Subsystem** – attack logic, damage, collision  
- **Enemy AI Subsystem** – behavior & movement  
- **Menu System** – title screen, in-game menus  
- **Game State Subsystem** – camera, score, level state
